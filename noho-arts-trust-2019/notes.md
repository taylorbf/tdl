having a note pattern and using *<1.1 1.2 1.3> creates a cool fragmentation




{-
 strategy for north adams section
 - have an array of the scale/mode generally, prewritten
 - navigate through it with a phasor or tri wave
 - modulate the beginning and ending of the tri wave
 - start to work with space / panning / jux
 - add bass note
 then... ?
 - experiment with note or speed modulation, detuning, or phasing
 - try slowing it down to hear the pattern?
    - would work great if you're polyrhythming it!

-- list of ongoing questions

-- randcat
-- randomization within patterns?
-- using scales from arrays?

sections:
gamut
north adams
wash
one word   -- done but needs tuning
shooting stars / seashells
composed ending


-- one word can be done by mixing zoom and shuffle and a normal pattern (no array needed)
